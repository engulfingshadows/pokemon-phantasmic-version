# Pokemon Phantasmic Version

Pokemon Phantasmic Version is set in the same pre-Mega Evolution universe as the first five generations of mainline Pokemon games. Some of the story is concurrent with Lucas's defeat of Cyrus at the summit of Mt. Coronet, while the majority of the story takes place afterward. This is also roughly around the time when Ethan defeats Red atop Mt. Silver. The story focuses on mysterious events occurring in a now-expanded Fullmoon Island and Newmoon Island.
